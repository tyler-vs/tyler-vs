Hi, I'm Tyler (a junior front-end developer),

I am a support specialist and junior front-end developer at [We Are Underground](https://www.weareunderground.com/). I help out our Shopify Merchants that use our themes to make their online business ideas into a reality. I also contribute to the theme's code, debug and submit bug fixes and write theme documentation.

I love front-end development and working on the web and with Shopify. I strive to write clean, efficient, problem solving code. I prefer spaces over tabs. I have a website, [my website](https://tylervanschaick.com/), but have a lack of articles to read. Other quick bits:

- Iâ€™m currently working on Shopify Themes.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Liquid.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on something Shopify related.. need to check.
- Grow With Google Front-end Nano Degree Student
