Hi, I'm Tyler

I'm am a front-end developer at [We Are Underground](https://www.weareunderground.com/), I help out our Shopify Merchants that use our themes to make their online business ideas into a reality. I occasionally contribute to our theme's code, debug and submit bug fixes and write some of our theme documentation viewed by many merchants. I am also an Arctic Code Vault Contributor!

I love working with Shopify, Liquid, HTML5, CSS, Git and GitHub and JavaScript and feel accomplished when writing clean, efficient, problem solving code. I prefer spaces over tabs. I have a website, [my website](https://tylervanschaick.com/), but need to publish more articles on it.

- Iâ€™m currently working on Shopify Themes.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Liquid.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on something Shopify related.. need to check.
