Hi, I'm Tyler

I'm am a front-end developer at [We Are Underground](https://www.weareunderground.com/), I help out our Shopify Merchants that use our theme's to make their online business a reality... and sometimes even contribute to the theme's code.

I love Shopify, HTML5, CSS and JavaScript and Shopify and writing clean and efficient code. I need to write more for [my website](https://tylervanschaick.com/) but it has a few Shopify related articles on it.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Shopify Themes.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Liquid.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on something Shopify related.. need to check.
