Hi, I'm Tyler

I'm am a front-end developer at [We Are Underground](https://www.weareunderground.com/), I help out our Shopify Merchants that use our themes to make their online business ideas into a reality. I occasionally contribute to our theme's code, debug and submit bug fixes and write some of our theme documentation viewed by many merchants. I am also an Arctic Code Vault Contributor!

I love working with Shopify, Liquid, HTML5, CSS and JavaScript and writing clean and efficient code and I prefer spaces over tabs. I need to write more for [my website](https://tylervanschaick.com/) but it has a few Shopify related articles on it.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Shopify Themes.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Liquid.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on something Shopify related.. need to check.
